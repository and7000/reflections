Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork: like a copy of another repository in github, where you have no permission to modify.
clone: like a copy of another repository where you can sinc, either locally ou remote.
branch: for a local test of a feature, inside your rep.
